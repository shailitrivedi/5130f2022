How to launch the Project?

To launch the project, you will need Java SE 11
		Check your system has java install or not by writing command java-version
			- Use Eclipse IDE to run the Spring Boot
		You need any IDE tool for spring.
			- You need MySQL Database
    In Eclipse go to file-->import-->existing maven project-->next-->Browse Folder path-->Finish
 
	We have pom.xml where all the dependencies are specified so all the required JAR files will be installed by the IDE.
 
	    - Check the application. Properties file under src  main  resources where you need to provide the username and password of your MySQL workbench.
